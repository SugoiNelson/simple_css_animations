# CSS SLIDESHOW TESTING

## Challenge :
Testing CSS animations. Rule : no JavaScript because JavaScript is evil (not really).

## Was it really a challenge?
Not really. Animations and keyframes are fairly understandable.

## Steps :

+ infinite_loop_slider : manipulating X axis to move a few pics in a slider

+ spin_to_win : making a loader, inspired by waiting a few minutes on the League of Legends loading page.

+ fb_loader : making an oldschool loader like the one facebook had. I don't know if they still have it since I don't use Facebook anymore.

+ yoyo : a circle that goes down and up. I got the idea this morning when I saw a kid with a yoyo in the metro and honestly it was easier than expected.

+ flip : a circle that flips, like a coin. Add some JS maybe and you can do a nice coin-flip. Head or tail?

+ swag-shadow : have you seen those old movies with logos that has a cool ass shadow? I tried to do that.

+ sonic : a barely recognizable sonic running around a green-hill-themed rounded rectangle

## Next step :
I don't know, find a hobby I guess.
Those animations are very small project I might re-use one day (or not).
You can easily find those online but I found most tutorials boring with unnecessary bullshit where the final result can be pretty simple and straight forward.

## No, honestly what is this repo?
This repo will allow me to try a few stuff with CSS animations.
Don't expect me to do much styling outside the animations since it's like a lab where I test stuff I'll probably need (or not) in the future. You can contribute, if you think you can teach me a few things (which you probably can).
